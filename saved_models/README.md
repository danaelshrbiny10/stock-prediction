# Saved Model Weights

This folder contains saved model weights for the stock prediction models. Model weights are stored in HDF5 format (.h5) files, which preserve the trained parameters of the machine learning models.

## Contents
model_weights.weights.h5: This file contains the saved weights of the stock prediction model. These weights represent the learned parameters of the neural network model trained on historical stock price data.

## Usage
You can use the saved model weights to:

- Load the trained model architecture and weights for further training or fine-tuning.
- Perform inference on new data to make predictions using the trained model.

## How to Use
To use the saved model weights:

- Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the saved_models directory.
- Load the model weights into your machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras) using the appropriate functions or methods.

```
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

# Load the model architecture and weights
model = load_model('model_weights.weights.h5')
```

## Note
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies and environment set up to load and use the model weights. The saved weights are compatible with the model architecture used during training.
